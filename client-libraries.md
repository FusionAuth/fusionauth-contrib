# Client Libraries

FusionAuth supports a number of [client libraries](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/client-libraries/). 

However, community members have created libraries other languages as well.

* [Elixir](https://hex.pm/packages/fusion_auth)
* [Swift](https://github.com/f0rever-johnson/fusionauth-swift-client)

If you'd like to learn more about creating a supported client library, please see the [client library builder repo](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-client-builder).
